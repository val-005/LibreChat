# Locally test the app during development

## WIP

## Run the tests

#### 1. Install the global dependencies

   ```shell
   npm ci
   npx playwright install --with-deps
   ```

#### 2. Run tests

   ```shell
   npx playwright test
   ```
   
If everything goes well, you should see a `passed` message.
